# ClimatePolicyDiffusionParadox
This repository contains files to reproduce results from the associated paper titled "The paradox of climate policy diffusion".
This is the version associated with the second revision of the paper, July 2025.

This repository contains the main R markdown file, the resulting Word and csv files containing the baseline results (zip file "Baseline") as well as various robustness checks reported in the Supplementary Information of the paper.

Separate zip folders for specific robsutness checks such as scenario with EU as a single agent (zip file "EU"), data without air pollution policies (zip file "without air pollution"), fixed weights of trade flows  (zip file "FixedWeights") and a placebo scenario (zip file "Placebo") are uploaded as zip folders (see the Methods section of the associated paper for more details).

These files should be sufficient to reproduce the results as well as the data necessary to run the code.

Before running the R code, please make sure to install all the associated packages mentioned in the code, save the data files on your computer and update the working directory in the code.
